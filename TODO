- How do we deal with missing data?
- Companies without any data - black?


Done


May 23rd - May 27th
    - Populate everything with user friendly information
    - units on scatter plot
    - Scrape company URLs w/ blockspring https://www.blockspring.com/help/google_sheets
    - Incorporate "Reset" button somewhere else in the UI
    - Better tooltip for map
    - a color legend on what the colors mean needs to be provided on the geomap
    - we need to somewhere show the "active filters" maybe as breadcrumbs at the top..
    - as much as i like the row coloring, I am struggling with how color-dense the table looks. I suggest that in the column for the sustainability score, you add a small colored square. the row should stay white. use very thin light gray lines to differentiate row entries..
    - when hovering over row entries in the table, the row should highlight in a very light gray for feedback
    - use a cleaner Arial-like font. It needs to be "less heavy" than what's there. let's avoid using bold font if possible.
    - if you sort a column, indicate whether it's sorted A-Z or Z-A or up or down (for quantitative). and which columsn is sorted. There are some nice icons that you could use for that.
    - the filter tooltips are very long, we need to figure out how to make this more concise
    - i see that the weights are working, but it is not immediately clear to the user. we need to figure out a way to make it more intuitive
    - Wondering what if had all three visualizations show at once. I would probably put the "table list" at the bottom. The scatterplot top right, the geo top left. That way you can see them all at once.

May 30th - June 3rd
    - Logo for each filter panel
    - Logo for canopy
    - Company logos

June 6th - June 10th
    - Expansion of each table row
    - PDF integration & viewer / download
    - Scrape company URLs

* 10 hours / week*

June 13rd - June 17th
- Binary selectors for binary variables (ex. Climate change policy implemented), integrate with existing weighing mechanisms

June 20th - June 24th
- Transition dynamically for the "best" view on scatter plot (based on plotted bubbles)

June 27th - July 1st
- Analytics; different mechanisms for variable weighing?

July 4th - July 8th
- "About" page explaining each variable / data source / etc
